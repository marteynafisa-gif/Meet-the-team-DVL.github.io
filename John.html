      <h2 class="section-title">Favorite Hobby</h2>
      <p>My experience as an amateur violinist spans over eleven years. I began at age six, dedicating time to my elementary and middle school orchestras, followed by two years in the BCSO during college. Since completing my mandatory Air Force military service in Korea, I am now adjusting to junior year college life. This past summer, however, I obtained a Korean Drone License, and I am now seeking to leverage that expertise to earn my FAA Part 107 Drone Pilot Certificate.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Favorite Thing About Working in the Lab</h2>
      <p> I most enjoy being available to support any students with software questions I can answer, reinforcing that the DVL is always open to anyone needing assistance. My personal project focus is on earning my FAA Part 107 Drone Pilot Certificate, and a future goal is to expand that knowledge by learning various drone imagery processing tools.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Other Involvements Around Campus</h2>
      <p>I am currently involved only with the Data Visualization Lab (DVL). As likely the longest-pursuing Geological Sciences major in the department (a 5th year due to my military service), I also consistently attend the weekly seminars hosted by the EESC department.</p>
