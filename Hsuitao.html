<p>Hi! My name is Hsiu (pronounced “Sho”) and I graduated in 2025 from BC with a major in Environmental Studies and minors in in Sociology and Computer Science. I am skilled in Python, MatLab, and Java. I’ve worked on StoryMaps, MatLab tutorials, MetaQuest VR applications, and some visualizations of CO2 data. I’m interested in working on aggregating data and creating more visualizations! Outside of school and work, I like to watch TV shows and read some books. Check out my work below!</p>
